Downloading Binaries
--------------------

Ensure that the __four__ essential binaries exist in the __binaries__ folder of the demo project. The binaries folder structure should resemble the list below:

1. [jboss-datagrid-6.2.0-server.zip](https://www.jboss.org/download-manager/content/origin/files/sha256/4f/4ff65968bcc104d0b8d5795ce4caa42f60615fca3eca8462e59fea76ed23d154/jboss-datagrid-6.2.0-server.zip)
2. [jboss-eap-6.2.0.zip](https://www.jboss.org/download-manager/content/origin/files/sha256/62/627773f1798623eb599bbf7d39567f60941a706dc971c17f5232ffad028bc6f4/jboss-eap-6.2.0.zip)
3. jdg-visualizer.war
4. hotrod-demo.jar

Every attempt has been made to automate the download of items #3 and #4. For #1 and #2, you need to have a [http://www.jboss.org](http://www.jboss.org) community login to be able to download the binaries. 

If you do not have a login, its about time you had one! [Click here](https://community.jboss.org/register.jspa) to register!
